instructions

In front of you is a wall of fire erupting from the ground, if only there was a way to douse the flames...

Let's learn how to use the power of water! Enter the following command:

 ./fight.sh fire-wall inventory

"fire-wall" is your first argument. This is locking onto your first target with the amulet's first usage.
"inventory" is your second argument. This is how you are accessing the water amulet to use it.
Good luck!
