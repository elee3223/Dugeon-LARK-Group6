As you make your way into the next corridor, another rush of memories hit you...

"They're right here!" exclaimed one of the S.T.O.N.E henchmen that we attended the mission with.
"Brilliant" murmed the head of the coporation, cloaked in the shadows of the cave the stones were held in. "Get rid of the dead weight..."
In that instance they all turned against us. Number 3: stabbed in the back. Number 4, shot on sight. Number 1 took out one of the
henchmen, but he was too late to stop hte gunshot planting him as motionless as the concave walls around him.
I was the only one left, and there I was, staring at the gravel like celing, surrounded by nothing but the corpses of my fellow night raid mercenaries...
no. I was surrounded by the corpses of my own brothers...

'They will pay for this' echoed through my head as I proceeded into the next room
