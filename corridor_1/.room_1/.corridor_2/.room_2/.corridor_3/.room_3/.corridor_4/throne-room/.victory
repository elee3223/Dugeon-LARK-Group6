you won
The S.T.O.N.E leader limps agianst the side of the palace-like wall. 
"No... this can't be... I... u-..."
He collapses to the floor, the stones once wielding him with so much power roll onto the floor in front of your feet. You did it. Your brethern are avenged.
You go up and grab the stones, and the amulets your currently possess start interacting near the presence of the stones. once they touch. a tri-powered beam
of all three elements erupts, creating a path outside of the throne room. You walk outside, the sun is setting in the off horizon, as a lone cardinal sweeps across the crisp air.
What will I do now? Who will I become? What does this life even have left for me?
Who knows. Theres always gonna be more jobs to do, and I'll be damned if I'm not the one to get them done...
