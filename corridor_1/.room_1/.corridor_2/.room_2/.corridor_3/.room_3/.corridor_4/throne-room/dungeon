Your procede into a dark and ominous room, when in front of you pillars of flame erupt parralel on both sides to illuminate a tall figure sitting on a royal-like throne.
The head of the S.T.O.N.E Corporation.
"I see you've come this far... heh... pretty impressive for someone who I thought I left dead underground with the rest of his maggot crew. You're too late. 
The stones are mine, and the only way you're getting to them is over my cold dead body"
The figure proceeds to get out of his throne, wielding two stones shimmering strongly through the creases of his fingers. 

Here you will avenge your bretheren from this hearless monster in front of you. This is it.
