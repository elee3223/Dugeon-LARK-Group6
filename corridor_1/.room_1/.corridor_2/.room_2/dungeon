instructions

A large plant appears to be blocking the path into the next corridor. It's vines spread across the exit, and bits and pieces of scattered bone fragments lie
around  the base of the thorned vines wrapping across the wall. Looks like you will need to do something about this plant before moving onward.

Recall how you took down the wall of fire...
Try the same method to take down this obstacle!
(Hint: ./fight.sh plant-vines fire)
